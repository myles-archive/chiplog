**Chiplog** is a simple way to enter notes that get time/date stamped. It's a way to document what you're doing without having to deal with how to manage it. It's written in Django.

Inspired by Cliff Stoll's Log Book in [Cuckoo's Egg](http://readernaut.com/trey/notes/68/).

The name is taking things back to [where the word "Log" came from in the first place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_log).
